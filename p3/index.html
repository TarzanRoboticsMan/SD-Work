				    The Physics of CSS
			</h3>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    CSS is essentially mapping HTML elements to rectangular boxes that can be
			        positioned on the x-, y- and z-axis.
			</p>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    There is a single place these HTML elements usually live in: the normal
			        flow. Elements in the normal flow are born as inline, block elements, or
				    not displayed. Not displayed elements are those like meta tags or style
				        tags which aren’t visually rendered by the browser. However, HTML elements
					    can also be born outside of the normal flow, and interact with the normal
					        flow in their own way: like floats, relative elements, and fixed elements.
						    Let’s take a look at inline and block elements.
			</p>
			<h3>
				    Inline vs. Block
			</h3>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    Every HTML element has three different states: Block, Inline or not
			        displayed.
			</p>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    A block level element will naturally span the entire available width,
			        without concern about how much horizontal space it actually needs. As a
				    result of that, a block level element will automatically push following
				        content to a new line, so by default, two block level elements can't stand
					    next to each other - the first will push the second one to the next line
					        (floating elements will allow this though, but more on that later).
			</p>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    However, an inline element does not break the current flow. An inline
			        element only takes up the space it needs to render its content and after
				    that, more inline elements can be displayed.
			</p>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    A good way to remember the difference is to think of an inline element as a
			        line of text/sentence and a block level element as a paragraph - the
				    sentence can stand together with other sentences to form an entire
				        paragraph, but the paragraph breaks the natural flow to create space around
					    it.
			</p>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    <img
              src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ic0_t6-hwLeU7qPLkYHy5sXOj-6XI8oSxt2cc5alpd1JalPfaYPt7T6Q9EkjAJUmrht4QKkhjU1_VE_1ML38JMS22gTSgPgpZ2UShN8XuRKbDxQjyTJFxq9i9ENPR5Fije3xHja1"
	              width="624"
	               height="83"
		    />
			</p>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    An example of inline elements include span tags (the generic inline
			        element), links (anchors), images and form fields like input. Common block
				    level elements include div tags (the generic block level element), header
				        tags (h1-h6), paragraphs, lists and tables.
			</p>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    Another important fact is that width and height properties are ignored for
			        inline elements. Instead, you can use the line-height property to make an
				    inline element smaller or bigger, as the space between each line grows or
				        shrinks.
			</p>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    You will also see margins and paddings acting differently than you might be
			        used to, when applied to inline elements. In general, if you need to create
				    space between or inside elements, you may want to use a block level element
				        instead. If you're trying to use inline elements because you want two or
					    more elements to stand next to each other, then a floating block level
					        element might be more suitable.
			</p>
			<h3 dir="ltr">
				    Outline vs. Borders
			</h3>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    While most HTML elements don't have a border by default, CSS does support
			        the feature, with a range of border related properties.
			</p>
			<h5 dir="ltr">
				    Border color
			</h5>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    As per usual.
			</p>
			<h5 dir="ltr">
				    Border width
			</h5>
			<p dir="ltr">
			    The width can be either an absolute value, a relative value, or one of the
			        pre-defined border width values: Thin, medium or thick. If you use the
				    pre-defined values, it's up to the browser to interpret them, which
				        basically gives you less control of how yo
